# hello-world
my first experience with GitHub

I am a guy who started too late on his adventure in coding. But i know i will succeed.
It will be hard. It will be scary. I will be afraid, and i will be under pressure for all time.
But there is hope. And with this hope as my strength i will push beyond my current limits.
Because i gotta make up for all the time i had lost over the past many years.
